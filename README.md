## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to build a **real-time Weather & Air Quality Dashboard** in **Power BI**, leveraging live API integration to provide actionable environmental insights for four major Indian cities: **Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Coimbatore**.

## 🔧 Tasks Performed

* API connection & data extraction
* Data cleaning & transformation (Power Query)
* Data modeling & measures (DAX)
* Visualization design in Power BI
* Created interactive & user-friendly dashboard

## 📊 Metrics Monitored

* 🌬 **Wind Speed** – Monitor breeze conditions
* 💧 **Humidity** – Track moisture in the air
* 💨 **Pressure** – Atmospheric condition trends
* 🔎 **Visibility** – Clear vs foggy skies
* ☀️ **UV Index** – Sun exposure risks
* 🌧 **Precipitation** – Rainfall probability

## 🎨 Key Visuals & Features

* **Forecast Trends** – 7-day temperature forecast
* **Sunrise & Sunset Timings** – Daylight planning
* **Chance of Rain** – Visual precipitation likelihood
* **Air Quality Index (AQI)** – Real-time pollution levels (PM10, SO2, CO, O3, etc.)

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Applied

* **Power BI** – Dashboard design
* **Power Query** – Data transformation
* **DAX** – Measures & calculations
* **API Integration** – Fetching live weather & AQI data
* **Data Storytelling & UI/UX** – Clear, engaging dashboard presentation

## 🔗 API Integration Explanation

The weather and air quality data was imported using a **Live Weather API**.

Steps followed:

1. Copied the **API endpoint URL** from the weather provider.
2. In **Power BI Desktop**, selected **Get Data → Web**.
3. Pasted the API link (JSON format).
4. Used **Power Query Editor** to clean and transform raw JSON into structured tables.
5. Built data models and created **DAX measures** for calculations.
6. Designed the final interactive dashboard with cards, charts, and gauges.

## 🎯 Outcome

* Built a **real-time, interactive environmental monitoring tool**.
* Transformed complex weather data into **visually engaging and actionable insights**.
* Strengthened expertise in **real-time analytics, API handling, and UX-focused dashboarding**.

## 📌 Data Source

* Live Weather API (OpenWeather / AQI Provider)
